In this document, I discuss two articles about banning AI chatbots in schools and how it may be used for cheating. 

## Article 1
Guardian's [New York City schools ban AI chatbot that writes essays and answers prompts](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/06/new-york-city-schools-ban-ai-chatbot-chatgpt) explains why the schools have banned ChatGPT amid fears that students could use it to cheat. They believe that “While the tool may be able to provide quick and easy answers to questions, it does not build critical-thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for academic and lifelong success." 

## Article 2
On contrary, NYT's [Don’t Ban ChatGPT in Schools. Teach With It.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/12/technology/chatgpt-schools-teachers.html) argues that instead of being threatened by it, schools should thoughtfully embrace ChatGPT as a teaching aid. They believe that, firstly, banning ChatGPT won't work in a practical level. There is no real method to strictly ban it from students. Also, ChatGPT teaches students about the world they’ll inhabit because tools like ChatGPT will always be there, and even improve through time. That is, the Age of Artificial Intelligence.
